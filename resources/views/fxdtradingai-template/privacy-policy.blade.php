     8. Rights
    </h2>
    <p>
     Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection

          laws in relation to your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
     You have the right to:
    </p>
    <p>
     Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data

          subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the

          personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully

          processing it. We hereby reserve our right to charge a relevant fee

          for providing such record of personal data to a client, except where

          this is not allowed under local legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This

          enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about

          you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new

          data you provide to us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to

          delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us

          continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete

          or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised

          your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have

          processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to

          erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that

          we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for

          specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,

          at the time of your request.
    </p>
    <p>
     Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a

          legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something

          about your particular situation which makes you want to object to

          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental

          rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are

          processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some

          cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds

          to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables

          you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the

          following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s

          accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not

          want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we

          no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend

          legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we

          need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use

          it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.

          We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your

          personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

          Note that this right only applies to automated information which you

          initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the

          information to perform a contract with you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to

          process your personal data. However, this will not affect the

          lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your

          consent or that is needed further to regulatory or legal requirements.

          If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain

          products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at

          the time you withdraw your consent.
